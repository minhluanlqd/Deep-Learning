CIFAR-10 open-ended challenge\n","\n","In this section, you can experiment with whatever ConvNet architecture you'd like on CIFAR-10. \n","\n","Now it's your job to experiment with architectures, hyperparameters, loss functions, and optimizers to train a model that achieves **at least 70%** accuracy on the CIFAR-10 **validation** set within 10 epochs. You can use the check_accuracy and train functions from above. You can use either `nn.Module` or `nn.Sequential` API. \n","\n","Describe what you did at the end of this notebook.\n","\n","Here are the official API documentation for each component. One note: what we call in the class \"spatial batch norm\" is called \"BatchNorm2D\" in PyTorch.\n","\n","* Layers in torch.nn package: http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html\n","* Activations: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#non-linear-activations-weighted-sum-nonlinearity\n","* Loss functions: http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions\n","* Optimizers: http://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html\n","\n","\n","### Things you might try:\n","- **Filter size**: Above we used 5x5; would smaller filters be more efficient?\n","- **Number of filters**: Above we used 32 filters. Do more or fewer do better?\n","- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n","- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster? See https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BatchNorm2d.html\n","- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n","    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax]\n","    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax]\n","    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax]\n","- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n","- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use Dropout.\n","\n","### Tips for training\n","For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and other hyperparameters. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n","\n","- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n","- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n","- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n","- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and save your test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n","\n","### Going above and beyond\n","If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these, but don't miss the fun if you have time!\n","\n","- Alternative optimizers: you can try Adam, Adagrad, RMSprop, etc.\n","- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n","- Model ensembles\n","- Data augmentation\n","- New Architectures\n","  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n","  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n","  - [This blog has an in-depth overview, although the code uses Tensorflow](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n","\n","### Have fun and happy training!
